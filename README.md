# TT.com
tt.com is an online ticket booking website for IRCTC / Indian Railways.= which solves a key problem in the system.

24 Million People use Indian Railways on a daily basis. Even with such a large network and ecosystem.
2 Major Problems arises :
 1) Users find the tickets to be in waiting list almost every time, 
 2) Indian Railways suffer huge losses 15000 CR + in 2022

We would be solving this problem using our project :
It would include a unique feature that while booking, 
that is if a seat isn't available from source to destination station, it will search if the train is available for partial journey .
ie Lets suppose a user search from station 1 to station 10 but a seat isn't available for the whole journey.,
then the website will search if a seat is available for partial route lets say station 3 to station 10. 
Thus Through the site, user can find the seat available for partial route and site would also search an alternative seat for the remaining journey:
  a) in Same Coach
  b) In different class
  c) or the user can travel through unreserved seat
